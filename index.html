Spring LDAP is a Java library for simplifying LDAP operations, based on the pattern of Spring's JdbcTemplate. The framework relieves the user of common chores, such as looking up and closing contexts, looping through results, encoding/decoding values and filters, and more.

## 特性

* Provides LDAP template which eliminates the need to worry about creating and closing LdapContext and looping through NamingEnumeration
* Comprehensive unchecked Exception hierarchy built on Spring's DataAccessException
* Contains classes for dynamically building LDAP filters and Distinguished Names (DNs)
* Client-side LDAP transaction management
* Much more...
